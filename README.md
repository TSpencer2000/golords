# GolordsBot

A discord bot that has completely random features, but it's mine :)

# Commands

- !8ball - ask 8 ball a question
- !roll {}d{}[+{}d{}]* - roll however many dice
- !poll - start a vote with reactions
- !lookup - dnd 5e srd information lookup, which is a little broken
- !addquote & !getquote - fun quote storage. State is shared between servers, which will change soon
- ``@someone ++`` \ `@someone ++12` \ `@someone --` - give someone karma
- !stacks @someone - check someone's karma
- (Karma is also shared between servers, which will change soon)
- !eqn {LaTeX} - Quick view any latex as a transparent image

# TODO

- Server-specific state for quotes and karma
- Implement !topstacks
- Remove non-existant command prompts
- Sort messages in help
- _Maybe_ spin up a small help site instead of the text message. Don't really wanna pay for a domain name for something nobody actually uses
- Clean up message from !contribute
